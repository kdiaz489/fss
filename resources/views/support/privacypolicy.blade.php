    <h1 class="display-5">Data Protection Statement and Consent to Use of Data at fillstorship.com</h1>
    <p>
        Data protection is a matter of trust and your trust is important to us. So that you can feel secure when visiting our websites, 
        we strictly observe the statutory regulations in processing your person-specific data and we would like to inform you here about our data acquisition and data utilization. 
        The following data-protection statement explains to you which data is collected from you on our websites, which parts of this data we process and use and in which way, and
         to whom you can turn with any concerns or requests.
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">1. Acquisition, Processing and Utilization of Person-Specific Data</h1>
    <p>
        Person-specific data describes details relating to the actual or personal relationships of a specific or identifiable natural person. Such details include, for example,
        your name, your telephone number, your address, and all existing data that you disclose to us during registration and when opening your customer account.
       
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">1.1 Customer Account</h1>
    <p>

        For each customer who registers with us via the REGISTER function, we set up a customer account, i.e. password-protected, direct access to his or her existing data stored
        by us. This allows you, amongst other things, to view your already-concluded, still open and recently sent orders, or to manage your personal data and the newsletter.
       
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">1.1.1 Setup of the Customer Account</h1>
    <p>
        The following data must be given during the registration for a customer account (obligatory disclosures):
        – your e-mail address
        – your password
        – your forename
        – your first name
        – your last name
        <br>
        Your billing and delivery address need not be given until you order something. For your order we need your correct name, address and payment data. We need your e-mail address
        so that we can confirm receipt of your order and its dispatch, and so that we can communicate with you in general. We also use your first name and last name to identify you
        (as a log-in name), when you visit your customer account.
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">1.2 Acquisition, Processing and Utilization of Your Person-Specific Data</h1>
    <p>
        We collect, store and process your data for the entire processing of your purchase, the technical administration, our own marketing purposes (more information on these under
        point 2.3) and to prevent criminal offences and fraud. Your person-specific data is only passed on to third parties to the extent that this is legally permissible, including
        the purpose of processing the contract or for invoicing, for marketing or if you have previously consented to this. When processing orders, for example, the service companies
        used by us (transport companies, logistics companies, Paypal) are sent the data they require for processing and concluding orders. The data passed on to our service providers
        in this context may only be used by them for fulfilling their duties.   
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">1.3 Newsletter</h1>
    <p>
        For sending the Newsletter we make use of the e-mail address given by you and for this we need your confirmation that, as the owner of the e-mail address, you consent to its
        receipt .Should you later decide that you no longer want to receive a newsletter from us, you can object to this at any time without thereby incurring any other costs. There
        is, of course, also a cancellation link in every newsletter.
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">2. Cookies</h1>
    <p>
        The acceptance of cookies is not a prerequisite for access to our websites. We draw your attention, however, to the fact that our website and service has only limited functionality,
        if you do not allow us to place cookies. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">What are cookies?</h1>
    <p>
        Cookies are small files that are stored on your data carrier and hold certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. Basically speaking there are 2
        different types of cookies: the so-called session cookies, that are deleted as soon as you close your browser; and temporary/permanent cookies, that are stored on your data
        carriers for a longer period or without limit. This type of storage helps us to design our websites and our offers for you and makes it easier for you to use them in that,
        for example, certain input from you can be stored so that you are not required to enter this repeatedly. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-5">How we use cookies</h1>
    <p>
        We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer
        needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
        <br>
        Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to
        your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
        accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

        and delete themselves after the pre-specified period. The cookies of our partner companies also contain solely pseudonymous - mostly even anonymous - data.       
    </p>


    <h1 class="display-5">3. Log Files</h1>

        which you came to the websites), the quantities of data transferred, product information and the version of the browser used.These log file data records are evaluated by
        us, to help us further improve our offer and the FillStorShip site, as well as to make these more-user-friendly, to detect and correct errors more quickly and to control server capacities.
